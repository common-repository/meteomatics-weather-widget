The most accurate weather forecast widget for WordPress, powered by the Meteomatics Weather API.

== Description ==
Enhance your website with real-time weather updates using the Meteomatics Weather Widget plugin for WordPress.
With customizable display options and seamless integration, keep your visitors informed about current weather conditions in a location of your choice.

Simply add the widget to your sidebar, footer, or any widget-ready area to provide valuable weather information to your audience.
Whether it's sunny skies or stormy weather, our plugin ensures your website remains a reliable source for up-to-date weather data. It showcases temperature trends and intuitive weather icons representing the general forecast for the upcoming three days.

Tailor your widget to perfection with a range of options:
- Pinpoint the exact forecast location with latitude and longitude inputs.
- Opt for a vertical or horizontal widget layout.
- Select your preferred temperature scale, be it Fahrenheit or Celsius.
- Customize the background color to suit your site's aesthetic.

The plugin is powered by the Meteomatics Weather API, the most accurate weather data provider. The weather data displayed on the widget comes from Meteomatics’ unique forecasting system, which selects the best weather model for your location and time to provide the most precise forecast. It updates automatically every 5 minutes, so you don’t need to refresh the page.

With this plugin, you have the flexibility to pick a location by manually entering its coordinates. This allows you to get real-time weather data and a forecast for the upcoming days, specific to the location of your choice. We respect user privacy – the plugin does not use or track the user's personal location data. The weather information displayed is solely based on the coordinates you input.
